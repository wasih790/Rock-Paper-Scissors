    <!-- Pseudocode -->
    <!-- 1. create a function to return a random value for rock, paper and scissors by the computer -->
    <!-- 2. ask player for a string value, for rock, paper, or scissors -->
        <!-- 2a. should accept rock, ROCK, RocK as a value-->
    <!-- 3. Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. 
        The function should take two parameters, computer value and player values-->
        <!-- 3a. compare the both value according to the game, and return the winning value, and player/computer -->
        <!-- 3b. return value should look like "You Lose! Paper beats Rock" -->
    <!-- make a function called game, and play 5 rounds of the game, to see the winner -->

<h2>Rock Paper Scissors</h2>
<p>you must enter a value of Rock Paper or Scissors for 5 times, because the game is for 5 rounds</p>
<p>Please look at the console for the output</p>
<p>A user interface on the browser screen will be added later</p>
